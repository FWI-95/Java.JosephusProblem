# JosephusProblem

 * 	A legend says:
 * In a war, there was a group of fighters surrounded by a roman legion.
 * The group didn't want to be captured, so they figured to commit suicide.
 * They stood in a circle and the first began to kill the second. The third killed the fourth, the fifth the sixth and so on.
 * So every one will kill the next living person until the last, who will commit suicide.
 * 
 * Josephus didn't want to commit suicide, so he wanted to know, which will be the last living person in this circle so he can get captured.
 * 
 * if n = 2^a + l
 * then W(n) = 2l + 1
 * 
 * where l < 2a
 * 
 * if 13 = 8 + 5
 * then 11 = 10 + 1
